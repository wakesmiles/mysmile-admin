## Deployment on Vercel

This project has already been deployed. Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will automatically be deployed. Because this app is currently being used with real data, it is highly recommended to create a new branch to test features and merge the new branch to main once the feature being tested is fully implemented. To view the Vercel dashboard for this app, log into Vercel using Github with the Github credentials provided by the Wake Smiles dental clinic admin.
